# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis Project

Hospital readmissions, particularly unplanned ones, place a significant burden on healthcare systems, patients, and insurers. Frequent readmissions can be symptomatic of gaps in the quality of care, inadequate follow-up, or poor management of chronic conditions. Understanding the key drivers of readmission is essential for improving patient outcomes and reducing operational costs.

This project aims to analyze a hospital dataset to identify patterns and predictors of patient readmissions.

### **Project Objectives**

- Provide actionable insights to healthcare stakeholders to improve care transitions and patient follow-up.
- Identify opportunities for personalized care planning based on patient characteristics and medical history.
