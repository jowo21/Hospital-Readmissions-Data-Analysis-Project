# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis Project

Hospital readmissions, particularly unplanned ones, place a significant burden on healthcare systems, patients, and insurers. Frequent readmissions can be symptomatic of gaps in the quality of care, inadequate follow-up, or poor management of chronic conditions. Understanding the key drivers of readmission is essential for improving patient outcomes and reducing operational costs.

This project aims to analyze a hospital dataset to identify patterns and predictors of patient readmissions.

### **Project Objectives**

- Provide actionable insights to healthcare stakeholders to improve care transitions and patient follow-up.
- Identify opportunities for personalized care planning based on patient characteristics and medical history.

### **Stakeholders**

- **Hospital Administrators:** Interested in reducing readmission rates to avoid penalties and improve care efficiency.
- **Healthcare Providers & Clinicians:** Seek to understand patient risk profiles and adapt treatment and discharge plans accordingly.
- **Quality Improvement Teams:** Focused on identifying gaps in care that lead to avoidable readmissions.
- **Patients and Advocacy Groups:** Want better continuity of care and health outcomes post-discharge.

### About the Dataset

The dataset includes information such as age range, time spent in hospital, number of lab procedures, medications administered, history of previous visits (inpatient, outpatient, emergency), provider's medical specialty, various diagnostic codes, glucose testing, changes in diabetes medication, and the readmission status. 

This dataset is composed of 25000 rows and 17 columns.

### Executive Summary

The largest contributing factor to a reduction in hospital readmissions is the number of healthcare visits a patient had before being admitted to the hospital.  There was no distinction between what type of healthcare visit the patient attended (Outpatient, Inpatient or Emergency), but once the patient, on average, had about two healthcare visits prior to being admitted to the hospital, their readmission rates dramatically decreased.
